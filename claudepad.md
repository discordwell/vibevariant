# Session Summaries

## 2026-03-12T02:40Z — Upgrade MCP server: 8 → 13 tools with CLI parity
- Migrated all tools from deprecated `server.tool()` to `server.registerTool()` with MCP annotations (readOnlyHint, destructiveHint, idempotentHint, openWorldHint)
- Added 5 new tools: `vibariant_delete_experiment`, `vibariant_experiment_show`, `vibariant_goals_list`, `vibariant_goals_confirm`, `vibariant_status`
- Added `generateCodeStructured()` to codegen.ts: returns `{ files: [{path, content}] }` instead of markdown
- Added 3 API methods to api.ts: `deleteExperiment`, `listGoals`, `confirmGoal` + 204 void response guard
- Extracted helpers (compact, resolveProjectId, aggregateStatus, findExperiment) to `helpers.ts` to avoid top-level await side effects in tests
- compact() now returns `{items, total, truncated}` when truncating arrays (prevents LLMs reasoning on incomplete data)
- Fixed create_experiment auto-start bug (now returns draft status matching CLI behavior)
- Fixed update_experiment truthiness check (`!== undefined` instead of `if (val)`)
- 29 MCP tests passing (13 codegen + 16 server helpers), 62 CLI tests still passing
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md: "8 tools" → "13 tools"

## 2026-03-12T00:31Z — Restore MCP as opt-in secondary integration
- Recovered `packages/mcp/` from git history (commit 4a1d087): 8 MCP tools, API client, codegen
- New hidden `vibariant mcp-install` command with shared `installMcpConfig()` helper
- `vibariant init --mcp` flag: interactive prompt defaults to No, `--yes` without `--mcp` skips MCP
- Updated ARCHITECTURE.md: "Claude Code Integration" → "AI Agent Integration" with primary (CLI+skills) and secondary (MCP) sections
- Fixed Commander.js `.hidden()` incompatibility → used `addCommand(cmd, { hidden: true })`
- Fixed URL parameter injection in MCP api.ts (`encodeURIComponent` on projectId)
- Added `homeDir` option to `installMcpConfig` for testable global scope
- 67 tests passing (62 CLI including 7 new mcp-install tests, 5 MCP codegen tests)
- Code review: inherited issues (stale response in create_experiment, no timeout on API calls, top-level await) documented but not changed since files recovered verbatim

## 2026-03-11T16:40Z — CLI-first Claude integration (replace MCP)
- Deleted `packages/mcp/` entirely — CLI is now sole AI integration surface
- New `vibariant codegen` command: generates SDK integration code, `--json` returns file contents
- New `vibariant experiments show <id-or-key>`: combined experiment details + stats
- CLI hardening: consistent JSON envelope `{ok, data}` / `{ok, error}` on all commands, `--yes` flag to skip prompts, exit codes 0/1/2/3, stderr for human output in `--json` mode
- Created Claude Code skill at `.claude/skills/vibariant/SKILL.md` + `workflows.md`
- `vibariant init` now auto-installs skill + updates CLAUDE.md in user projects
- Skill template bundled in `packages/cli/src/lib/skill-template.ts`
- Removed `mcp-install.ts` command, cleaned all MCP references from ARCHITECTURE.md, landing page, memory
- 49 tests passing (22 new), clean build
- Code review fixes: if/else clarity after jsonError(), delete confirmation prompt, unused imports removed, detectEnvironment() deduplication

## 2026-03-11T—:—Z — Landing page implementation
- Built full marketing landing page at `/` replacing redirect-only page
- 7 new components in `dashboard/src/components/landing/`: BifurcationBackground, LandingNav, HeroSection, FeaturesSection, DemoSection, PricingSection, FooterSection
- Bifurcation strategy: fixed background layer (split line + gradient washes) + per-section SVG decorations (no clip-path)
- Interactive demo: live A/B simulation with Beta-Binomial Monte Carlo (2000 samples), auto-starts on scroll via IntersectionObserver, speed controls (1x/5x/10x)
- Auth-aware nav: shows "Start Free" or "Go to Dashboard" based on JWT in localStorage
- Pricing: Free/$0, Pro/$29, Team/$99 with feature comparison
- Code review fixes: MC samples 100→2000 (reduce jitter), derived state refactor (useMemo vs useState+useEffect), Winner label fix (A vs B), ARIA attributes (progressbar, aria-pressed, aria-disabled, aria-label)
- Smooth scroll via `scroll-behavior: smooth` in globals.css
- Build clean, deployed, wet tested in browser

## 2026-03-11T—:—Z — Login page bifurcation design
- Implemented bifurcation visual identity on login page: abrupt style split at screen center
- Desktop: vertical split (left=blue geometric, right=orange organic); Mobile: horizontal split
- GeometricSide component: pixel grid, stepped waveforms, circuit paths, angular brackets, "A" watermark
- OrganicSide component: S-curves, overlapping circles, sine waves, spiral, ellipses, "B" watermark
- Brand text updated: "Vib" blue, "ariant" orange; button gradient blue→orange
- CSS: `.bifurcation-a/.bifurcation-b` clip-path classes in globals.css, responsive via `@media (min-width: 768px)`
- Design philosophy recorded in CLAUDE.md
- Deployed to production (vibariant.com), verified live

## 2026-02-28T00:40Z — One-click CLI + MCP server shipped
- @vibariant/cli: full setup wizard, device-code auth, CRUD for projects/experiments/goals, framework detection, code generation
- @vibariant/mcp: 8 MCP tools for Claude Code integration (auth, projects, experiments, results, codegen)
- API: POST /projects, CLI device-code auth (cli-login/cli-poll/cli-complete), GET /auth/me
- npm workspaces root linking CLI, MCP, SDK packages
- Code review fixes applied: email mismatch security check, 0600 config permissions, credential expiry consistency, dead code removal, hardcoded path fix, docker template path fix
- 91 tests passing (SDK 59, CLI 27, MCP 5), committed as 4a1d087
- Remaining refactor opportunities: extract shared API client package, consolidate resolveProjectId helper

## 2026-02-26TXX:XXZ — Stats Engine v2 implementation complete
- All 10 phases implemented: epsilon stopping, ROPE, TopTwo Thompson, adaptive priors, calibration, winsorize/CUPED, shrinkage, API schemas, dashboard UX
- 135 tests passing (73 existing + 62 new), all backward compatible
- Dashboard builds clean with 5 new components + rewritten experiment detail page
- generate_recommendation() now returns dict instead of str (breaking change, existing tests updated)
- New DB migration: 4 columns on experiments + experiment_results table
- Code review agents launched for correctness + refactoring

## 2026-02-26T11:10Z — Phase 5 COMPLETE: deployed to OVH VPS
- All review fixes committed and pushed (25a470a, 0cfe60f)
- Docker images built on VPS, all 3 containers running (db healthy, api 8090, dashboard 3002)
- Kamal proxy routes added: vibariant.com → dashboard, api.vibariant.com → API
- TLS auto-provisioned via Let's Encrypt (will work once DNS is pointed)
- Pending: register vibariant.com domain, point DNS to 54.37.226.6 (A records for @, www, api)
- Pending: GitHub OAuth app setup (fill GITHUB_CLIENT_ID/SECRET in .env)

## 2026-02-26T10:15Z — Phase 5 review fixes + Suspense boundary fix
- Fixed CRITICALs: auth pages, port mismatch, loading spinners, logout race, Suspense boundaries
- Extracted completeLogin() helper to deduplicate auth flow
- Dashboard builds clean (11 routes)

## 2026-02-26T09:35Z — Phases 3-4 completed + code review fixes
- Phase 3 (SDK auto-tracking + goal detection) and Phase 4 (stats engine) completed by parallel agents
- Code review found 3 HIGH issues: proxy camelCase field mismatches (SDK sends maxDepth/activeTimeMs, proxy expected snake_case), engagement events not fetched by engine, unconfirmed goals counted as conversions
- All 3 HIGH issues fixed + 2 moderate refactors (shared MC sampling utility, unified goal-matching helper)
- 73 stats tests + 59 SDK tests passing, SDK builds clean
- Committed and pushed as cf215c2
- Phase 5 (dashboard polish + deployment) is next

# Key Findings

## API port
Default port is 8000. Docker compose exposes via API_PORT env var (default 8000).
Dashboard api.ts defaults to http://localhost:8000.

## Local PostgreSQL setup
Using local PG (not Docker) at localhost:5432. Database: vibariant, user: vibariant, password: localdev.
PostgreSQL binary at /opt/homebrew/Cellar/postgresql@16/16.11_1/bin/psql.

## Python dependencies
Installed with --break-system-packages flag on macOS Homebrew Python 3.12.

## Key file contracts
- SDK scroll: sends `maxDepth` (camelCase) in payload
- SDK engagement: sends `activeTimeMs` (milliseconds) as `engagement` event type
- Proxy: handles both camelCase (SDK) and snake_case formats
- Engine: fetches engagement events in addition to page_view/heartbeat
- Conversions: only `conversion` events + `goal_completed` with confirmed goal types count
